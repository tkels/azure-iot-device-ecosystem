# Introduction

**About this document**

This document describes how to connect [MSP432E4 Launchpad](http://www.ti.com/tool/MSP-EXP432E401Y) device running TI-RTOS or FreeRTOS with Azure IoT SDK. This multi-step process includes:
-   Configuring Azure IoT Hub
-   Registering your IoT device
-   Build and deploy Azure IoT SDK on device

 These instructions apply specifically to a user who is using TI’s SimpleLink MSP432E4 SDK and SimpleLink MSP432e4 SDK Azure IoT Plugin software found at [dev.ti.com](http://dev.ti.com/tirex/#/). The Quick Start Guide that is included with your Plugin installation (you should be able to access this via the "docs" folder of the Azure SDK Plugin installation) provides more accurate instructions that apply specifically to the Plugin installation. 

 Alternatively, there are instructions in the [README.md](https://github.com/TexasInstruments/azure-iot-pal-simplelink/blob/master/README.md) for a user who has directly cloned or downloaded the [“azure-iot-pal-simplelink”](https://github.com/TexasInstruments/azure-iot-pal-simplelink) PAL repository. Please note that it is highly recommended to follow these TI Azure SDK Plugin instructions, versus cloning or downloading “azure-it-pal-simplelink” PAL repository directly, if you are just getting started.  The PAL repository provides a basic example running on TI-RTOS with makefiles for the TI compiler.  Full support for TI, GCC and IAR toolchains and FreeRTOS is provided via the Plugin installation.

# Step 1: Prerequisites

You should have the following items ready before beginning the process:

-   [Setup your IoT hub][lnk-setup-iot-hub]
-   [Provision your device and get its credentials][lnk-manage-iot-hub]
-   [MSP432E4 Launchpad](http://www.ti.com/tool/MSP-EXP432E401Y)

Please ensure that your device has been updated with the latest firmware and or service pack (instructions for updating the firmware and/or service pack are included with the SimpleLink SDK installation).

If you are new to TI’s SimpleLink MCU platform and unfamiliar with the [MSP432E4 Launchpad](http://www.ti.com/tool/MSP-EXP432E401Y) it is recommended that you start with [TI’s SimpleLink Academy](http://dev.ti.com/tirex/#/?link=Software%2FSimpleLink%20MSP432E4%20SDK%2FSimpleLink%20Academy) Introduction.
